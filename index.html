                                        The 5-week online summer school with the title “From Data to Decision: Assessment of the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Security Nexus” will support young researchers in understanding the cross sectoral character of sustainable resources management and development. They will be enabled to select and apply data and tools to assess Nexus system and to suggest adequate Nexus sound solutions. <br><br>
                                        The summer school is structured in three different steps towards an integrated understanding and management of the WEF Security Nexus: 1) System understanding, 2.) qualitative and quantitative assessments and modelling tools 3.) Nexus related decision-making and planning.
